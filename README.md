## Guidance

1. To get started first you have to write,test and migrate your smart contract.
2. Migrated contract `JSON` file should be in `/client/src/contracts` folder.
3. First you need to import That JSON file inside `App.js` file and pass as second argument of `getContract` function.This will return an Object.There are two property of that object one is contract instance and another is contract address.

4. Then you need to change NavText if you want to.

5. If you want to use `ipfs` in your project.There is a file called `ipfs.js`.You have to just import `ipfs` object from that file.If you do not know how to use ipfs and how to upload files you can read source code of my project i'm giving link bellow.
